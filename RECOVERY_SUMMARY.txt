================================================================================

BUILD FROM STRENGTH: Use this as an opportunity to create a BETTER site than
the old WordPress version. Focus on:

1. Professional design showcasing scale and expertise
2. Client testimonials and case studies (gather from clients)
3. Clear value proposition and competitive differentiation
4. SEO optimization for local agricultural keywords
5. Mobile-friendly design for farmers in the field
6. Easy contact methods (click-to-call, simple forms)

The lack of old content is actually GOOD - fresh start with best practices!
