## Kern Irrigation Scheduling - Content Recovery & Website Rebuild

**Date:** November 20, 2025

## THE SITUATION

The old WordPress site at **kisag.co** has been replaced with a new/redesigned site. You asked me to recover all old content from:
- Wayback Machine archives
- Google Cache
- Online presence (social media, business listings)
- Any other available sources

7. **Value proposition** and competitive advantages
8. **Facebook presence** (2 pages identified)
9. **Business registration** details

### ⚠️ CHALLENGES
Unfortunately:

1. **No Wayback Machine archives** - The old WordPress site was not archived (or archives aren't accessible)
2. **No Google Cache** - Google discontinued their cache feature in 2024
3. **No old site backup found** - Would need to check with Nick if he has files
4. **Limited testimonials/reviews** - None found online
5. **No LinkedIn presence** - Company or owner not found on LinkedIn
6. **Minimal social media** - Only Facebook, no Instagram/Twitter/YouTube

## RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Roadblocks & Solutions

**"Nick is too busy to participate"**
→ Batch feedback sessions, provide multiple options, make decisions independently where possible

**"No budget for professional photography"**
→ Use high-quality stock photos initially, or coach Nick on taking good smartphone photos

**"Clients won't provide testimonials"**
→ Offer incentives, write draft testimonials for their approval, do video interviews (easier than writing)

**"No immediate traffic/leads"**
→ Set realistic expectations, focus on long-term SEO, quick wins with Google Business Profile

**"Competitors copy the site"**
→ That's a compliment! Focus on ongoing content and relationships, not just design

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### My Professional Opinion

**This is a great project with strong potential.** Here's why:

1. **Solid foundation** - 35 years in business, major clients, proven track record
2. **Clear differentiation** - CCAs, 30,000 acres, specialized expertise
3. **Underutilized online presence** - Lots of room for improvement
4. **High-value market** - Agricultural consulting is lucrative
5. **Low competition online** - Local competitors have weak websites

**The opportunity:** A well-executed website with testimonials, case studies, and SEO could significantly increase lead flow and allow KIS to be more selective with clients (higher quality, higher prices).

**The risk:** If Nick is too busy to participate or doesn't see the value, the project will stall. Need his buy-in and time commitment.

**My recommendation:** Start with a focused, high-quality core site (Home, About, Services, Contact) that can launch in 6-8 weeks. Add testimonials and case studies as we gather them. Expand with additional pages over time based on performance data.

**Budget sweet spot:** $5,000-$8,000 for initial site, then $1,000-$2,000/year for maintenance and content. This gets professional quality without breaking the bank.
