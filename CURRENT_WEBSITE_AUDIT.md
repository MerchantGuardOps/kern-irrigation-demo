- 35+ years in business (since 1984)
- 30,000+ acres managed
- Services across San Joaquin Valley, Ventura County, and Imperial Valley
- 147 Facebook likes (minimal social media presence)

3. **CCA team** - Professional credentials
4. **Advanced technology** - Pressure chambers, soil probes, automation
5. **Premium client base** - Major agricultural companies

### Missed Opportunities

3. **No client testimonials** - Working with major companies but no social proof
4. **No educational resources** - Could be THE resource for SJV irrigation knowledge
5. **Minimal local SEO** - Bakersfield location mentioned but not optimized
6. **No service area maps** - Geographic coverage unclear
7. **No team visibility** - Who are the experts behind the 35 years?

## Conclusion & Executive Recommendations

### Current State Summary
Kern Irrigation Scheduling has a **functional but severely underperforming** website that does not reflect their 35+ years of expertise, 30,000+ acre portfolio, or premium client base. The site serves as a basic online business card but misses virtually every opportunity to generate leads, demonstrate expertise, or differentiate from competitors.

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **Remove/fix casino blog content** - Immediate brand risk
2. **Add social proof** - Testimonials and case studies critical
3. **Expand service content** - Far too minimal currently
4. **Implement content strategy** - No ongoing engagement mechanism
5. **Build trust elements** - Team, credentials, certifications needed

### Investment Recommendation
Based on the company's scale (30,000+ acres) and premium client base, a **mid-range to premium redesign ($15,000-35,000)** is recommended. The current website is leaving significant revenue on the table through missed lead opportunities and poor positioning against competitors.

### Expected ROI
If KIS generates even 1-2 additional clients per year through improved digital presence, the investment would pay for itself. Given the high value of agricultural consulting contracts (likely $50-200+ per acre annually), the ROI should be substantial.

### Timeline Recommendation
**3-month intensive redesign** followed by ongoing content/SEO work:
- Month 1: Strategy, design, content creation
- Month 2: Development, photography, video
- Month 3: Testing, launch, optimization

### Next Steps
1. Schedule discovery call to understand business goals
2. Conduct stakeholder interviews (team, clients)
3. Develop detailed project scope and timeline
4. Create content strategy and editorial calendar
5. Begin design/development work
6. Implement tracking and analytics
7. Launch and monitor performance
8. Iterate based on data
