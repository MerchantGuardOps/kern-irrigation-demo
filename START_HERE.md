## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### About the Old WordPress Site:
Unfortunately, the **Wayback Machine does not have accessible archives** of the old WordPress version of kisag.co. The current site appears to be a new/redesigned version (not WordPress).

**This means:**
- We can't see exactly what the old site looked like
- We don't have the old content word-for-word
- We'll need to check with Nick if he has a backup

**However:**
- We have comprehensive information from current site
- We have business details from online sources
- We have enough to build an excellent new site
- The lack of old content is actually an opportunity to create fresh, better content

### About Google Cache:
Google **discontinued their cache feature in 2024**, so we can't access cached versions of pages.

### What This Means:
We're essentially **building from scratch**, which is actually GOOD because:
1. Fresh start with modern design
2. Optimized content from the beginning
3. No baggage from old site issues
4. Can implement best practices from day one

## 🏆 FINAL THOUGHTS

### The Opportunity
Kern Irrigation Scheduling has a **strong foundation** (35 years, 30,000 acres, CCAs, major clients) but an **underdeveloped online presence**. A well-executed website could:

✅ Generate more qualified leads
✅ Allow higher pricing (premium positioning)
✅ Reduce sales cycle (pre-educate prospects)
✅ Build brand authority
✅ Differentiate from competitors

### The Risk
If Nick is too busy to participate or doesn't provide assets, the project will stall. **Need his commitment** to:
- Attend scheduled calls
- Review and approve designs
- Provide logos, photos, testimonials
- Make decisions on time

### The Recommendation
**Start focused.** Build a core site (Home, About, Services, Contact) that can launch in 6-8 weeks. Add testimonials, case studies, and additional pages incrementally based on performance data and feedback.

**Budget sweet spot:** $5,000-$8,000 for initial site that's professional, effective, and scalable.
